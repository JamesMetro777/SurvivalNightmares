This build is not the same as the actual project that comes with it, 
since I extended the project recently 
but my extensions which are main menu and a shop, 
the shop is stopping the build from happening and to be honest,
I don't why because it should work 
(as these problems only show up when you building the game).
You can use keyboard and mouse or a gamepad to control the player
